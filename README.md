## functions
- supports multi ids
- supports multi cookies
- is asynchronous that makes it able to mass buy items
- uses aiohttp
- supports every device (linux, windows, mac)
- supports discord webhooks

## usage
- format of multiple ids:  
- new line for every new id
   
- format of multiple Cookies:
- new line for every new cookie
                           
you don't need multiple ids and cookies one also works
